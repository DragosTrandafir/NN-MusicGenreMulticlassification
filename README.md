This Jupyter Notebook contains a multiclassification machine learning model project which predicts the genre of a song, being required some features.

The file has multiple boxes, which should be run in order in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file). Here you can find a tutorial on how to run a Jupyter Notebook project https://youtu.be/r8BXJdE9ChE?si=lSu5zIOUttVggt0r, but there are plenty other tutorials on Youtube. Note that you should first clone the repository on your machine.  There are 2392 input data examples, each with their own features (input) and their genre (output) given in a csv file. The user can  input some personal features and run the model to predict what genre the song with the input features may be. All the other details of the structure and the algorithms are explained next to the code in every box.


For the tests, the data is splitted into training data, cross validation data and test data. Classification errors appear as numbers in the interval [0,1] and they represent a percentage of misclassified data by the model(eg 0.12 -> 12% error or 0.4301 -> 43% of data is missclassified).

The project is inspired by algorithms and ideas presented in the "Machine Learning Specialization" course, by Andrew Ng, from the Coursera official website. THIS PROJECT IS JUST EXPERIMENTAL, DO NOT RELY ON ITS RESULTS IN THE REAL WORLD.
